I'm starting to learn Swift. Having toyed with Dart (Flutter), and React Native I have decided the extra layers of abstraction aren't worth it to me, as someone who wants to be able to go from idea to device relatively easily (and with no prior mobile development experience).

[100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/) looks like a nice bitesize challenge, what better to do for an hour to day until COVID-19 passes?

Day 1 covers variables, simple data types, and string interpolation. Let's see how far I get ;)
